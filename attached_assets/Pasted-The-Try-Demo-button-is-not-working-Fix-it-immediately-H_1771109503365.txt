The "Try Demo" button is not working. Fix it immediately. Here's exactly what it needs to do:

1. When the user clicks "Try Demo" in the nav bar, it should skip the entire onboarding flow
2. It should automatically create a hardcoded demo profile with this data:
   - Name: "Alex"
   - Age: 34
   - Neighborhood: "Mission District, SF"
   - Gender: "Woman"
   - Pronouns: "She/her"
   - Interested in: ["Men", "Women"]
   - Values: ["Authenticity", "Growth", "Creativity"]
   - Friday night: "Try a new restaurant"
   - Relationship goal: "A serious relationship"
   - Communication style: "Warm and nurturing"
   - Non-negotiables: ["Emotional availability", "Intellectual connection"]
   - Love language: "Quality Time"
   - Conflict style: "Need space first then talk"
   - Committed relationship vision: "A partnership where we challenge and support each other equally"
   - Past relationship lesson: "I learned that compatibility in values matters more than chemistry alone"
   - Surprise fact: "I speak three languages and make pottery on weekends"
   - Dietary: ["No restrictions"]
   - Safety agreements: all true
   - References: [{name: "Jordan Lee", email: "jordan@email.com", relationship: "Close friend"}, {name: "Sam Rivera", email: "sam@email.com", relationship: "Colleague"}]

3. It should POST this profile to /api/profiles, then immediately call /api/match with that profile ID, then navigate directly to the results page with the matching data

4. If the API call fails for ANY reason, have a complete hardcoded fallback response with 3 gatherings, each with 4 people, different event types, match reasons, trust badges, and conversation starters. The results page should ALWAYS show something — never a blank screen or error.

5. Test that clicking "Try Demo" from the landing page goes: loading screen with animation → results page with 3 gatherings. The whole flow should take under 10 seconds.

This is for a hackathon demo recording happening in 30 minutes. It MUST work reliably every single time.
